Awards are bestowed in chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. 
Made available by the Nobel Foundation, the analysed data includes all prize winners from the beginning of all awards being granted from 1901 to 2023.


### Data Sources

The dataset used for this analysis is the "nobel.csv" file, containing detailed information about each award winner up to date ever since the Prize was established.

### Tools

- [Anaconda Navigator: ](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
  - To access the Jupyter Notebook


### Data Preparation

Only *the nobel.csv* dataset was first inspected and imported into a Pandas DataFrame to begin conducting the exploratory data analysis:


### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the nobel prize data to answer key questions, such as:

1.  What has been the most commonly awarded gender and birth country up to date?
2.  What has been the proportion of US-born winners per decade?
3.  What has been the proportion of female laureates per decade and category?
4.  Who was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize, and in what category?
5.  Which individuals and organisations have won the Prize for more than once?
