### Project Overview
---

The Nobel Prize is perhaps the most recognized scientific prize ever in the world. In this regard, awards are each year bestowed in the areas of Medicine, Chemistry, Physics, Economics, Literature and Peace.

Accordingly, this data analysis project conducted in **Python** is intended to examine all the Nobel Prize winners to date in an attempt to identify and explore undiscovered patterns hidden in the dataset provided.

Made available by the Nobel Foundation, the analysed data uncovers all prize winners from 1901 all the way to 2023.


### Data Sources

The dataset used for this analysis is the *"nobel_dataset.csv"* file, containing detailed information about each award winner up to date ever since the Prize was established.

### Tools

- [Anaconda Navigator: ](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
  - To access the Jupyter Notebook for **Python**


### Data Preparation and Preprocessing

The following data preparation and preprocessing tasks were undertaken:

1. The *nobel_dataset.csv* dataset was first inspected and then imported into two separate Pandas DataFrames.
2. NaN/non-existing values of certain records within particular columns were removed in one DataFrame.
3. An overhaul dictionary was designed to replace countries' former names with their current names, owing to political reasons and relevancy.
4. A column named *Decade* was formed to be able to classify prize winners as per a 10-year period.


### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the Nobel Prize data to answer key questions, including but not limited to:

1.  Which 10 countries have secured the Nobel Prize most up to date, and how many times?
2.  Who was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize, and in what category?
3.  From which year did the country that has achieved the most Nobel Prizes up to date managed to establish its relentless dominance?
4.  How does the visualisation of all Nobel Prize winners appear per award category, gender and decade?
5.  During the Second World War era, how did the award distribution per category and country look?
6.  During the Cold War era, how did the award distribution of each country per category look?


### Data Analysis

The following code helped me consolidate my knowledge in subsetting, filtering and then grouping the resulting subset by two separate categories for a count-type aggregate operation:

```python
female_winners = nobel_winners_df[nobel_winners_df['sex'] == 'Female'].groupby(['decade',
                                                                                'category']).agg({"prize":"count"})
```

In addition, the code below helped me clear out the blurry lines between a Pandas Series and DataFrames where each one of those have a different set of functions and methods.

By resorting to an integer-based indexing on my Pandas DataFrame below, I was able to fetch what I required and assigned it to a variable:

```python
top_birth_country = nobel_winners_df["birth_country"].value_counts().reset_index().iloc[0,0]
```

### Findings

The critical analysis results are summarised as follows:

1. The most commonly awarded gender and top birth country of the award winners turn out to be **Male** and **the United States of America** respectively.
   
2. The proportion of **US-born award winners** till 2000 was in a gradual uptrend, peaking at slightly higher than **the 0.4 ratio**, before dipping by nearly **25%** during early 2000s:

3. **Female award winners** have almost entirely dominated the disciplines of **Peace and Literature** as of the 2000s:

4. **Marie Curie**, n√©e Sklodowska was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize in the category of **Physics**.


### Limitations

The presumption is that the dataset provided by DataCamp encompasses all Nobel Prize winners up to date.
