### Project Overview
---

This SQL data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of small Brazilian e-commerce companies who processed orders via the largest department store in Brazil, **Olist**, over the years 2016, 2017 and 2018.

The following four aspects were taken into account while extracting the insights:

1. Order Analysis (OA)
2. Customer Analysis (CA)
3. Vendor Analysis (VA)
4. Payment Analysis (PA)

By analyzing the data from these lenses, the project is intended to identify trends, gaps and assists these firms with making data-driven recommendations while gaining a deeper understanding of the overall Brazilian e-commerce atmosphere.



### Data Sources

 the primary dataset used for this analysis is the "olist_orders_dataset.csv" file, containing detailed information about orders processed by a number of companies.
