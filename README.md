Awards are bestowed in chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. 
Made available by the Nobel Foundation, the analysed data includes all prize winners from the beginning of all awards being granted from 1901 to 2023.


### Data Sources

 the primary dataset used for this analysis is the "olist_orders_dataset.csv" file, containing detailed information about orders processed by a number of companies.

### Tools

### Data Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

1. Database creation from scratch
2. Tables creation, including assignment of primary and foreign keys
3. Plotting of an entity-relationship diagram (ERD)
4. Data import and inspection
